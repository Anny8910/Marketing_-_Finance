Net Present Value (NPV) looks to assess the profitability of an
investment on the basis that the money in the future is not worth
the same as the money today. Money loses value over time due to
inflation. However, the money today can be invested and earn a
return, making its future value possibly higher than a dollar
received at the same point in the future.
NPV is the value of all future cash flows (positive and negative)
over the entire life of an investment discounted to the present. It is
a form of intrinsic valuation and is used extensively across finance
and accounting for determining the value of a business, investment
security, capital project, new venture, cost reduction program, and
anything that involves cash flow.
